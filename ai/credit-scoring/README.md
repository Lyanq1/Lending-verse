# AI Credit Scoring System for LendingVerse

This directory contains the AI credit scoring system for the LendingVerse P2P lending platform.

## Overview

The credit scoring system uses machine learning to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers based on various data points. It provides a risk assessment that helps lenders make informed decisions about loan requests.

## Features

- **Multi-factor credit scoring**: Analyzes financial statements, business metrics, and historical data
- **Risk categorization**: Classifies borrowers into risk categories (A, B, C, D, E)
- **Default probability estimation**: Calculates the probability of loan default
- **Explainable AI**: Provides explanations for credit scores to improve transparency
- **Continuous learning**: Improves over time as more loan data becomes available

## Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and transforms raw financial data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features from financial statements and business metrics
3. **Model Training**: Trains machine learning models on historical loan data
4. **Scoring Engine**: Applies models to generate credit scores
5. **API**: Exposes scoring functionality to the backend

## Data Sources

The credit scoring system uses the following data sources:

- **Financial statements**: Balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements
- **Business metrics**: Years in business, industry, size, revenue growth
- **Credit bureau data**: External credit scores and reports (if available)
- **Transaction history**: Historical payment behavior on the platform
- **Document verification**: Results from document verification system

## Models

The system uses an ensemble of models for robust credit scoring:

1. **Gradient Boosting**: For classification of risk categories
2. **Random Forest**: For default probability estimation
3. **Neural Network**: For feature extraction from unstructured data
4. **Logistic Regression**: For interpretable baseline scoring

## Integration

The credit scoring system integrates with the LendingVerse platform through:

1. **REST API**: For real-time credit scoring requests
2. **Batch processing**: For periodic re-evaluation of existing borrowers
3. **Event triggers**: For scoring updates when new data becomes available

## Deployment

The system is deployed as a containerized service that can scale based on demand.

## Ethical Considerations

The credit scoring system is designed with fairness and transparency in mind:

- **Bias mitigation**: Techniques to identify and reduce algorithmic bias
- **Explainability**: Clear explanations of factors affecting credit scores
- **Compliance**: Adherence to relevant regulations (GDPR, FCRA, etc.)
- **Human oversight**: Human review of model decisions in edge cases

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

- **Alternative data sources**: Incorporation of non-traditional data for more inclusive scoring
- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of borrower financial health
- **Industry-specific models**: Specialized models for different business sectors
- **Federated learning**: Privacy-preserving learning across multiple data sources
