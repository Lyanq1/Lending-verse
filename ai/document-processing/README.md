# Document Verification System with OCR

This directory contains the document verification system for the LendingVerse P2P lending platform. The system uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract information from financial and business documents, verify their authenticity, and provide structured data for credit assessment.

## Features

- **Document Classification**: Automatically identify document types (financial statements, business plans, tax returns, etc.)
- **Information Extraction**: Extract key financial and business information from documents
- **Fraud Detection**: Identify potentially fraudulent or manipulated documents
- **Data Validation**: Validate extracted information against business rules and external data sources
- **Structured Output**: Convert unstructured document data into structured formats for analysis

## Components

1. **Document Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize document images for OCR
2. **OCR Engine**: Extract text from document images
3. **Document Classification**: Identify document types and templates
4. **Information Extraction**: Extract structured data from OCR text
5. **Validation Engine**: Validate extracted information
6. **API**: Expose document processing functionality to the backend

## Supported Document Types

The system supports the following document types:

- **Financial Statements**: Balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements
- **Tax Returns**: Business tax returns, personal tax returns
- **Business Registration**: Business licenses, certificates of incorporation
- **Bank Statements**: Business and personal bank statements
- **Identity Documents**: Passports, ID cards, driver's licenses
- **Business Plans**: Business plans and projections

## Integration

The document verification system integrates with the LendingVerse platform through:

1. **REST API**: For document upload and processing
2. **Webhook Notifications**: For asynchronous processing results
3. **Structured Data Output**: For integration with credit scoring system

## Technologies

The system uses the following technologies:

- **OCR Engines**: Tesseract OCR, Google Cloud Vision, Amazon Textract
- **Machine Learning**: Document classification, entity recognition
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV for document preprocessing
- **Natural Language Processing**: spaCy, NLTK for text analysis
- **Validation**: Rule-based validation, external API integration

## Deployment

The system is deployed as a containerized service that can scale based on demand.

## Security Considerations

The document verification system is designed with security in mind:

- **Data Encryption**: All documents are encrypted at rest and in transit
- **PII Handling**: Personally identifiable information is handled according to data protection regulations
- **Access Control**: Strict access controls for document access
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all document operations

## Future Improvements

Planned improvements include:

- **Multi-language Support**: Expand OCR capabilities to additional languages
- **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Enhanced techniques for detecting document manipulation
- **Template Learning**: Automatic learning of new document templates
- **Blockchain Verification**: Integration with blockchain for immutable document verification
